**PART 1**

I chose the bug in the `reverse` method where some of the original variable values were being overwritten too early.

A failure-inducing input for this method would be any set of more than 2 distinct elements.

Here is the code I used to find this:

``` java

@Test
 public void testReverseInPlaceAgain()
 {
   	int[] input1 = { 3, 5, 7 };
   	ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
   	assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 7,  5, 3 }, input1);
 }

```
