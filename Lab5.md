**Part 1**

Student: "Hello, I am a normal student writing an EdStem post as I need help debugging my program. I am having some trouble with my autograder, particularly one of the repositories from week 6 is causing me great trouble and anguish! My `grade.sh` bash script runs perfectly for all of the repositories except for the `list-methods-filename` repository. I know that this repository, which is my failure-inducing input, has the wrong name for the java file, but do not know what else to do or where to start debugging! I am totally freaking out, please help!"
